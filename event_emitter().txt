event emitter :
* it is used to handle events
* to initialize:
    var eventemitter = new EventEmiiter()
* some methods 'on' and 'emit'
    myEmitter.on('someEvent', function(mssg){
    console.log(mssg)
    })

    myEmitter.emit('someEvent','the event was emitted')
    
* node will recognize the module & it will go out & it will fetch thatmodule for us so this module is called events.

* emit() is used to trigger an event
* on() is used to add callback function that is going to be executed when the event is triggered
*uril()-> its a utility module which allows us to inherits the object.
